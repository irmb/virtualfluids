VirtualFluids (VF) is a research code developed at the Institute for Computational Modeling in Civil Engineering (iRMB) at the Technical University Braunschweig. The code is a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solver based on the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) for turbulent, thermal, multiphase and multicomponent flow problems as well as for multi-field problems such as Fluid-Structure-interaction. It includes distributed pre- and postprocessing capabilities for simulations with more than 100 billion degrees of freedom.

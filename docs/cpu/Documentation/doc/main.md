## Introduction
*VirtualFluids* is an adaptive, parallel Lattice-Boltzmann flow solver 
which is comprised of various cores 
and use second order accurate compact interpolation at the interfaces, 
coupling grids of different resolutions. 
The software framework is based on object-oriented technology and uses tree-like data structures. 
These data structures are also suitable for hierarchical parallelization using a combination of PThreads and MPI and dynamic load balancing.

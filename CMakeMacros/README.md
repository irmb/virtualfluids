# CMake Macros

The cmake macros provide the functionalities for creating targets (executables and libraries), finding files and linking against common libraries.

This repository provides only the macros, which can be integrated in your cmake project as (e.g.) git subtree or just downloaded and copied into the project folder. An usage of this macros with a lot of examples can be found here: [CMake Template on Github](https://github.com/ClubOfDigitalEngineering/CMakeTemplate "CMake Template on Github").
